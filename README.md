# Prediction-Hourly-Bike-Users
This is a Data Analytics and Data Science project that I worked on for my Python course at university.

The goal of this project is to predict the total number of Washington D.C. bicycle users on an hourly basis using a dataset (use attached hour.csv) with data from 2011 and 2012. 

Libraries used include: 
- matplotlib
- numpy
- pandas
- searborn
- datetime
- pylab
- sklearn

The main parts are: 
1) Exploratory Data Analysis - plotting, correlations, redundant & relevant variables, insights;
2) Data Engineering - text and date features, generating extra features, advanced insights, missing values & outliers handling, pipelines & transformations
3) Machine Learning:
3.1) Baseline linear regression models before & after data engineering with LinReg, Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net;
3.2) Baseline Random Forest;
3.3) Parameter Tuning using gridsearch and adjusting Random Forest Regressor with best parameters
3.4) Plotting predictions vs. reality with additional insights.
